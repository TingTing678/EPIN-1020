My work is a tentative travel plan to different countries of the world. I choose the theme of travel because in 20 years of my
life, I rarely go overseas. But as I am getting older and more financially capable, I would definitely want to explore 
different cultures, trying to get enlightenment and inspirations. I have deliberately included countries that most tourists
do not consider going, because I believe that by engaging in a completely different culture, I can learn much more than
expected. I also included pragmatic information like budgets and ways of commute. During this exercise, I have also discovered 
good sources for travel advice, which could be helpful for my upcoming term time exchange.
